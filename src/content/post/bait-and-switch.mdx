# The Bait-and-Switch in OTT/CTV Advertising: How to Protect Your Budget and Maximize ROI

In the fast-paced world of over-the-top (OTT) and connected TV (CTV) advertising, low cost-per-thousand-impressions (CPM) offers are everywhere. On the surface, these deals seem like the perfect way to stretch your ad budget further. But beneath the enticing promise of low costs lies a host of pitfalls that can erode your campaign’s effectiveness.

This blog will explore the hidden traps in low-CPM offers, the bait-and-switch tactics companies use to exploit uninformed buyers, and how savvy media buyers can protect their investments and get the best value for their campaigns.

## The Allure of Low CPMs and the Hidden Costs

Low CPMs can be a compelling hook for advertisers, but they often come with strings attached that compromise your campaign’s success. Here are some of the most common ways companies bait buyers and switch on delivery:

1. **Frequency Cap Manipulation**  
   Ads shown too often to the same viewers lead to fatigue and wasted impressions. Companies offering low CPMs may remove or severely limit frequency caps to artificially inflate impression counts.

2. **Rotator Overuse**  
   Instead of guaranteed premium placements, your ads might compete in rotators with dozens of others, reducing visibility and impact. This shotgun approach diminishes targeting precision and ROI.

3. **Unqualified Audience Targeting**  
   Low CPMs are often achieved by expanding audience criteria beyond your desired demographic, leading to irrelevant impressions and wasted spend.

4. **Selling Remnant Inventory as Premium**  
   Some providers disguise low-quality or leftover ad slots as "premium placements," leaving you with ads delivered during off-peak times or in low-engagement content.

5. **Blurring Viewability Metrics**  
   Providers may inflate metrics by counting impressions that aren’t fully viewable, such as ads skipped or closed before engagement, making performance appear better than it is.

6. **Hidden Fees**  
   Low CPMs often come with hidden technology, service, or platform fees that significantly increase the actual cost of your campaign.

7. **Bundling Low-Performing Inventory**  
   Premium slots may be bundled with low-performing placements, reducing overall campaign effectiveness.

8. **Lack of Transparency in Reporting**  
   Without detailed reporting, you can’t verify whether ads were delivered to the right audience or in the promised context. This opacity enables sellers to cut corners.

9. **Exclusive Contracts with Limited Flexibility**  
   Locking you into long-term commitments without room for optimization ensures the provider wins—even if your campaign doesn’t.

## How to Spot the Bait-and-Switch

Recognizing these tactics requires vigilance and the right questions. As a media buyer, always look deeper than CPM rates and demand transparency. Key red flags include:

- Limited or vague reporting on campaign performance.
- An overemphasis on CPM without discussion of other key metrics.
- Generalized audience targeting that lacks specificity.
- Contracts that require significant upfront commitments without flexibility.

## Smart OTT/CTV Buying: Protecting Your Budget

To avoid these traps and maximize the return on your OTT/CTV ad spend, follow these best practices:

1. **Demand Full Transparency**  
   Work only with providers who offer detailed reporting on audience demographics, viewability, and engagement. Transparency ensures accountability and allows for optimization.

2. **Focus on ROI, Not Just CPM**  
   Low CPM means little if it doesn’t drive results. Evaluate campaigns based on metrics like cost-per-acquisition (CPA), brand lift, or conversion rates.

3. **Enforce Frequency Caps**  
   Negotiate frequency caps to ensure your audience sees your ad enough to drive action, but not so often that it causes fatigue or frustration.

4. **Prioritize Premium Placements**  
   Opt for pinpoint placements over rotators, ensuring your ad appears in high-quality content that aligns with your brand and audience.

5. **Leverage Advanced Targeting**  
   Use customizable filters to refine your audience based on demographics, geography, and interests. Avoid broad targeting that inflates impressions but lacks relevance.

6. **Insist on Post-Buy Analysis**  
   Post-buy reporting verifies whether a campaign delivered on its promises, ensuring impressions were served to the right audience under the agreed-upon conditions.

7. **Test Before You Commit**  
   Start with small budgets to assess the provider’s delivery and results before scaling up your spend or signing long-term contracts.
