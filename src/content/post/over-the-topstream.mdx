## OTT (Over-The-Top) and CTV (Connected TV) vs. Cable and Broadcast TV

<b>OTT</b> describes the method of delivering video content directly over the internet, bypassing traditional cable or
satellite services. Services like <b>Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and YouTube</b>
allow users to stream shows and movies on-demand from various devices, such as smartphones, tablets, computers, and TVs.
This flexibility contrasts sharply with cable and broadcast TV, where programming follows fixed schedules and requires a
subscription to specific providers.

## What is CTV?

<b>CTV</b> refers to the devices used to watch OTT content on a TV screen. Examples include
<b>smart TVs</b> (like those from Samsung or LG), and devices such as <b>Roku, Amazon Fire Stick, and Apple TV,</b> or
even gaming consoles. CTV integrates OTT platforms directly into your television, enabling you to access a vast library
of content without relying on traditional cable infrastructure.

## Comparison:

<ul>
<li>
<b>Cable/Broadcast TV:</b> Operates on a rigid schedule and requires specific
infrastructure, such as a cable box or antenna. It broadcasts programs live, limiting
viewers to watch content when it airs unless they record it using a DVR.
</li>

<li>
<b>OTT:</b> Provides on-demand, internet-based streaming that viewers can access
anytime, from anywhere, using various devices. It offers flexibility and convenience
not found in traditional TV models.
</li>
<li>
<b>CTV:</b> Converts the TV into a digital hub, streaming OTT content through internetconnected devices, making it a modern alternative to cable setups. It delivers the
flexibility of OTT but with the comfort of watching on a large TV screen, unlike
smaller devices.
</li>
</ul>

<b>Summary:</b> While traditional TV ties viewers to fixed schedules and infrastructure, OTT and CTV allow for an
on-demand, customizable experience. The growing adoption of these technologies demonstrates a shift in how modern
audiences, especially younger demographics, consume video entertainment
