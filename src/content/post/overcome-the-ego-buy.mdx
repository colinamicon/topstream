# How We Help You Overcome the "Ego Buy" Challenge in OTT/CTV Advertising

In traditional TV advertising, it’s common for advertisers to hear from friends or family who saw their ad. This feedback creates a sense of visibility and reassurance—what we in the industry call the "ego buy" effect. However, OTT and CTV advertising operate differently, focusing on precision targeting. This means your ad reaches the right audience, not necessarily your immediate circle.

While this targeted approach drives results, it can leave you wondering if your ad is being noticed. That’s where we come in. Here’s how we help you overcome the ego buy challenge and confidently embrace the power of OTT/CTV:

## 1. We Replace Ego Metrics with Hard Data

Instead of relying on anecdotal feedback, we provide detailed reports that show:

- **Impressions Delivered:** How often your ad is shown to your target audience.
- **Engagement Metrics:** Insights like click-through rates, website visits, and calls.
- **Attribution Data:** Proof of how your ad drives real-world results, such as purchases or inquiries.

**What This Means for You:**  
You’ll have clear, actionable evidence that your ad is being seen by the people who matter most—your potential customers.

## 2. We Offer “Visibility Placements” for Ego Buy Reassurance

If feedback from friends and family is important to you, we can allocate a small portion of your budget for broad, untargeted placements. These ads ensure your personal circle has a chance to see your campaign, while the rest of the budget remains laser-focused on your target audience.

**What This Means for You:**  
You get the best of both worlds: personal recognition and business results.

## 3. We Educate You on the Power of Precision

Our team will work with you to reframe your perspective on visibility. Here’s how we explain it:

- **Targeted Advertising = Smarter Advertising:** Imagine a billboard that only appears to drivers who need your service. That’s OTT/CTV in action.
- **Ego Buy vs. ROI:** Would you rather everyone see your ad—or just the people who are ready to convert?

**What This Means for You:**  
You’ll understand the value of targeting and why reaching your ideal customer is more effective than general visibility.

## 4. We Leverage Social Proof for Personal Visibility

Want your friends and family to see your ad? We’ll help you repurpose your campaign for social media or other public-facing channels. By sharing your ad on platforms like Instagram, Facebook, or LinkedIn, you can engage your personal network while keeping your CTV/OTT strategy focused on conversions.

**What This Means for You:**  
You’ll satisfy the ego buy need without compromising your campaign’s precision and ROI.

## 5. We Help You Shift the Focus to What Matters

At the end of the day, your ad’s success isn’t defined by who sees it—it’s defined by the results it generates. With OTT/CTV, you’re targeting the right audience in the right way, ensuring your dollars are spent effectively. We’ll keep your campaign aligned with your business goals so you can:

- Reach the right customers.
- Generate meaningful actions.
